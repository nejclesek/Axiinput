Remote Input for gaming

Use this application for remote gaming input instead of the default input in common remote desktop software.


Follow these steps, for the best experience: 

Start with step 4 if you already installed everything.

1. Download from wiki page: https://github.com/nejclesek/Axiinput/wiki (or compile code)
2. Download AnyDesk: http://anydesk.com
3. Install/Run AnyDesk on PCs you want to connect to, DO NOT RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR (for best experience)

4. Connect with AnyDesk to the computer you want to play games on
5. On your remote PC that you are connecting to, open Axiinput, click "Use remote input" and click "Start Listening to input!"
6. On Your local PC, open Axiinput click "Use local input" and enter remote PCs IP (shown in remote Axiinput)
7. On your local PC in AnyDesk, open top-right drop-down settings menu
8. First Uncheck "Control mouse and keyboard", then Check "Show remote cursor" and click "Fullscreen mode" in the same menu
9. Now press Alt + X to connect your input via Axiinput.
10. You may see double cursor, one in the middle and the other normal, that's fine. Now run your game and have fun.


Tips:

* Make sure you run your games in "borderless window" mode, or press Alt + enter. You may get a black picture otherwise.
* Make sure port forwarding is configured, the default port is 8128, using UDP.
* For the best audio/video performance in AnyDesk ajust resolution of both displays, try to match them. Lowering resolution will improve response time and FPS that you actually receive.
